      <h2>What is food insecurity?</h2>
      <p>Although the US is one of the richest countries in the world, the hunger levels here remain high with 17 million households who experienced food insecurity in 2022. USDA defines food insecure households as those whose "access to adequate food for active, healthy living is limited by lack of money and other resources." There are many aspects contributing to food insecurity: inability to afford healthy food, the lack of access to grocery stores in the area, lack of time for cooking big meals, etc. Most of those are interconnected and can be traced back to economic inequality and systemic discrimination.</p>
      <p>Food insecurity has detrimental effect on the health of people affected. It can lead to malnutrition, obesity, and conditions like Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Research has shown that children who do not get enough nutritiotous food are more likely to struggle in school and have health problems later in life.</p>

      <h2>Causes of food insecurity</h2>
      <p>The roll-back of many of government-assistance programs from the pandemic era weakened the social safety net for many Americans. Another contributing factor is the rising prices of fresh produce and the declining relative price of junk food. The unaffordability of healthy food basically forces low-income families to buy high-calorie, nutritionally poor ultra-processed food that leads to obesity, malnutrition, and other weight-related conditions. Besides that, more than 10 million people in America live in food deserts: areas where no grocery stores with affordable healthy food are available within walking distance.

    <div class="causes-item revealable-shorter">
      <h4>The disproportionate impact of food insecurity on marginalized groups in the US</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
        In 2022, 1 in 5 Black and Latino people in the US experienced food insecurity. Systemic racism affects the access of <b>people of color </b> to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and other resources, which in turn affects their well-being, income, and ability to spend money on healthy food. The unemployment and low wages  contribute to food insecurity. Immigration-related ssues and language barriers can make it diffuiculty to find good-paid jobs and afford healthy food. Besides that, predominately Black and Native American communities can be a part of food deserts and do not have access to grocery shops with healthy and nutritionally-rich food in their area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Disability</b> status can also affect people's access to food. Disability can lead to reduced income due to job loss or low wages. It also increases household expenses as medical expenses on healthcare and adaptive equipment take up a significant part of earnings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Seniors</b> are also more likely to experience food insecurity. Chronic health conditions not only affect employment but also limit seniors' ability to travel and buy healthy food. Many seniors also do not have access to transportation, have fixed income, and do not have caregivers: all of those factors can lead to increased risj of food insecurity.

    <h2 id="center_headlines" class="revealable-shorter">The impact of food insecurity</h2>
    <div class="impact-container">
    <div class="impact-item revealable-shorter">
      <p> The limited availability of nutritious food options plays a significant role in shaping health outcomes. When people do not have consistent access to healthy food, they are at a greater risk of developing chronic health issues such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. These conditions not only diminish quality of life but also contribute to a shorter lifespan. Moreover, the financial burden faced by food-insecure adults often forces them to make difficult choices between buying groceries or covering medical expenses, further exacerbating existing health problems and potentially leading to more severe complications over time.
      </p>
      <p>Individuals who struggle with food insecurity may also experience higher levels of stress and anxiety due to uncertainty about their next meal. This can contribute to the development of mood disorders like depression and anxiety, which, in turn, can affect their ability to work, care for their families, or engage in social activities. Ultimately, the inadequate access to nutritious food, chronic health conditions, and mental health challenges are interconnected, which highlights the need for comprehnsive solutions to hunger in the US.

      <h3>Food deserts and their impact on the residents' health</h3>
      <p>Food deserts are geographic areas, where residents have limited access to affordable and nutritious food options. These areas are often characterized by a lack of easily accessible grocery stores, supermarkets, and fresh produce markets, making it challenging for residents to obtain healthy food. Instead, they may rely on convenience stores or fast food outlets, which often sell processed and unhealthy food  Food deserts disproportionately affect low-income communities and marginalized groups, exacerbating health disparities and contributing to higher rates of diet-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Addressing food deserts requires comprehensive solutions, including policy interventions, community initiatives, and investment in local food systems to ensure equitable access to fresh and nutritious food for all.

          <p>
            There are several federal programs thst aim to relieve food insecurity in the US. The three main ones are Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). One of the main legislations that regulate some of those food assistance programs is the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill was passed in 2018 and was extended through the 2024 fiscal year. Generally it is supposed to be renewed every five years by Congress under the jurisdiction of the Senate and House Committees on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Besides helping farmers, it also provides funding to SNAP, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, and the Commodity Food Supplemental program. Sign this petition to express your support for the Farm Bill and urge lawmakers to include more extensive food assistance programs in the next Farm Bill.

          <p>Food insecurity is getting worse right now because, broadly speaking, we have not succeeded in turning short-term fixes into workable, functional long-term policies. We need serious, sustainable, justice-driven transformations to the ways we think about feeding our communities.</p>
